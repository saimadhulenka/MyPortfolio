                "During my Java Fullstack internship, I gained hands-on experience working with both front-end and back-end technologies. I worked extensively with Java, Spring Boot, and SQL on the server side, and enhanced my front-end skills using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. I was involved in developing and integrating scalable, secure, and efficient web applications, collaborating with cross-functional teams to optimize performance and ensure a seamless user experience. This experience deepened my understanding of full-stack development, from database management and API integration to responsive front-end design, and has prepared me to take on complex projects in the future."

                During my internship, I familiarized myself with the Arduino Uno platform, learning about its components, functionalities, and programming language. I worked on various projects, starting with basic LED blinking and gradually advancing to more complex tasks like interfacing sensors and actuators. I gained hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and testing embedded systems. Additionally, I collaborated with mentors and team members, exchanging ideas and troubleshooting challenges together. Overall, my internship provided me with a solid foundation in embedded systems development using the Arduino Uno.
